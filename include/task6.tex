The service provider is expected to meet on a regular basis with MI staff involved in the project:
Monthly update meetings at the Marine Institute premises in Oranmore Galway with researcher providing the research services, 
6-monthly progress reports and meetings at the Marine Institute with the researcher providing the research services and contract manager.}

The service provider meet on a regular basis with Marine Institute staff involved in the project. 
The proposal is ambitious but achievable. However there needs to be good communication between the consortium and the Marine Institute to ensure the project keeps focused and delivers. Therefore we will arrange monthly face-to-face meetings, make all code, data and results available on the cloud and in a suitable repository (e.g. github) and provide a web based interface for model results.\\
Wider project 6-monthly progress reports and meetings at the Marine Institute will ensure the over-arching goals of the project are achieved.
